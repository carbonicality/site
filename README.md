# site
i never had a real, genuine portfolio site, or just in general a cool personal site to myself - so I decided, I would change that!

> **note** this script is HEAVILY inspired from https://phthallo.com/! please check their site out.

this website is powered by d3 (for the background), and the rest is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

i added (imo) PEAK music to the music player (click the play button on the home page to play):
- the bends (radiohead)
- fake plastic trees (radiohead)
- say it ain't so (weezer)
- faint (linkin park)

I submitted this site for Flavortown (Hack Club YSWS), but this site will be updated as I add new things.
